## Versioning

**VERSION:** 1.0

**RELEASE:** N/A

**LAST UPDATED:** December 13th, 2018

## Resources

**/design/:** Contains design documents used during implementation.

**/screenshots/:** Contains screenshots of implementation displayed above.

**/sound-recorder/:** Meteor application directory containing everything needed to run the application.

## How To Run

This system requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/install).

To run the application navigate to **/sound-recorder/** and run `meteor npm install`. After all packages have finished installing, run `meteor npm run start`. The application will load at **localhost:3000**.

If for some reason errors appear during runtime, try running `meteor reset`.

## Future Development

We hope to expand the functionality of the system we already have in place, as we were only able to add rudimentary features.
